# Unconnected Pipe Finder

![Screenshot](img/unconnected-pipe-finder.png?raw=true)


A factorio mod to help find pipes that aren't doing their job.
* Do you have an odd number of pipe-to-ground?
* Is your refinery not working 100%?
* Do your friends troll you by removing random pipes?

Press Shift+U to toggle the overlay, and find those pipes today!

Works with bobs pipes and valves (tested on Sea Block)

This is a modified version of [Orphan Finder](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Orphan%20Finder) that works with more than just pipe to ground.
